## Overview 

The OpenSeaR package contains datasets and functions to use in conjunction with the [OpenSea API](https://docs.opensea.io/reference/api-overview). The response from the API is cleaned from the JSON format and transformed into a clean dataframe. 

The package also contains some sample data from [Mutant Ape Yacht Club](https://opensea.io/collection/mutant-ape-yacht-club) which contains event data for 85 unique assets. In addition, sample data containing historical average price of some popular collections are also included. 

Functions inside the package include:

* `read_os_collection()`: Takes required API key and optional asset owner address and converts JSON format API call result into dataframe

* `add_logo()`: Adds OpenSea logo to ggplot object

* `scale_color_opensea()`: Adds OpenSea color palette to point/line ggplot 

* `scale_fill_opensea()`: Adds OpenSea color palette to for fill option 

## Installation 

Install development version from GitHub: 

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# If you haven't installed remotes yet, do so:
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rwu08/opensear")
```


## Basic usage


```{r}
library(opensear)
```


#### Retrieve data from OpenSea API 


```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
total_collection <- read_os_collection()
collection_one_owner <- read_os_collection(asset_owner = "")
```

#### Create graph with OpenSea Palette
```{r,include=FALSE}
library(opensear)
library(tidyverse)

mayc_avg_price$date <- as.Date(mayc_avg_price$date, "%d-%b-%y")
mayc_avg_price_filtered <- mayc_avg_price %>%
  filter(date <= "2021-09-30")
```

```{r ex1, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
example_plot <- ggplot(
  data = mayc_avg_price, 
  aes(x = date, y = avgprice, color = volume)
) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_opensea(
    palette = "dark", 
    discrete = FALSE, 
    reverse = TRUE
  )

example_plot
```

#### Add OpenSea logo to graphs
```{r ex2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
add_logo(example_plot)
```
