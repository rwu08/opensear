## Overview

The OpenSeaR package contains datasets and functions to use in
conjunction with the [OpenSea
API](https://docs.opensea.io/reference/api-overview). The response from
the API is cleaned from the JSON format and transformed into a clean
dataframe.

The package also contains some sample data from [Mutant Ape Yacht
Club](https://opensea.io/collection/mutant-ape-yacht-club) which
contains event data for 85 unique assets. In addition, sample data
containing historical average price of some popular collections are also
included.

Functions inside the package include:

-   `read_os_collection()`: Takes required API key and optional asset
    owner address and converts JSON format API call result into
    dataframe

-   `add_logo()`: Adds OpenSea logo to ggplot object

-   `scale_color_opensea()`: Adds OpenSea color palette to point/line
    ggplot

-   `scale_fill_opensea()`: Adds OpenSea color palette to for fill
    option

## Installation

Install development version from GitHub:

``` r
# If you haven't installed remotes yet, do so:
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rwu08/opensear")
```

## Basic usage

``` r
library(opensear)
```

#### Retrieve data from OpenSea API

``` r
total_collection <- read_os_collection()
collection_one_owner <- read_os_collection(asset_owner = "")
```

#### Create graph with OpenSea Palette

``` r
example_plot <- ggplot(
  data = mayc_avg_price, 
  aes(x = date, y = avgprice, color = volume)
) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_opensea(
    palette = "dark", 
    discrete = FALSE, 
    reverse = TRUE
  )

example_plot
```
